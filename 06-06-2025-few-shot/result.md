**Feedback 1**

Sentiment chain-of-thought: The user is complaining about the sensor stopping tracking frequently, even at a high polling rate (8000 Hz), indicating frustration with performance. They also mention the dongle failure on the first unit and emphasize the \$150 price, which further underscores their negative view of reliability versus cost. Overall, the sentiment is clearly negative.

isRelevant chain-of-thought: This feedback directly pertains to product performance (sensor tracking, dongle functionality) and user experience with the mouse. It is therefore relevant to product/UX evaluation.

**Feedback 2**

Sentiment chain-of-thought: The user states the product has no flaws (“no flaws in my opinion”), which is positive, but immediately balances it by saying it’s not worth the price because a cheaper alternative can achieve the same performance. This mix of praise for the product and criticism of its value equates to a mixed sentiment.

isRelevant chain-of-thought: The feedback discusses product value, performance, and price—which are central to user experience and purchase decisions—so it is relevant to product/UX evaluation.

**Feedback 3**

Sentiment chain-of-thought: The string is clearly an advertisement (“Play Raid Shadow Legends NOW!!! Click here to continue.”) and does not address any aspect of product experience or user feedback. It contains no evaluative content.

isRelevant chain-of-thought: This is spam/ad content unrelated to product or UX evaluation, so it is not relevant.
