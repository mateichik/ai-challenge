What brings you in here today? I'm just having this really sharp pain in my chest and I'm scared. I think I'm having a heart attack. Oh wow, um, you know, that must be really scary. When did this, uh, when did this pain start? It started about three days ago. Three days ago, okay. And where exactly in your chest do you feel it? It's kind of right here, right over my heart, I think. That's where it's the worst. Okay. And is it, uh, what kind of pain is it? Is it more like a dull pressure pain or is it a sharp pain? How would you describe it? I I'd say it's a sharp pain. A sharp pain, okay. And, um, so it started three days ago. Has it been coming and going or has it been constant? It just lasts for a few seconds and then it goes away. Okay. And does the pain, uh, come on when you're doing any activities or what, uh, when does the pain usually come on? Uh, it's usually worse when I'm coughing or I'm lying down. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And, um, does it improve with any positional changes at all or anything that you do that does it help? When I, when I lean forward, it actually does get better if I think about it. Yeah. Okay. And has this ever happened to you before? No, no, it hasn't. Okay. Okay. And on a scale of, uh, one to 10, one being the least amount of pain you felt and 10 being the worst, how much would you rate it? I'd say a six out of 10. Okay. And does the pain move, uh, anywhere in your chest or does it stay in the same spot? Yeah, I think it kind of goes to my neck sometimes. Okay. And do you have any other symptoms? Like, uh, do you have any shortness of breath, dizziness, anything like that? No, I don't. Okay. Any, any palpitations? Nope. Okay. And other than that, have you been having any other symptoms at all besides the pain? No, no, nothing else. That's it. Just have these, uh, short episodes of pain that last a couple of seconds. Okay. Um, have you, have you tried like any medications that has helped the pain? Yeah, I took some, um, I took some Tylenol and that did help. Okay. I took it once yesterday. All right. Um, any recent, uh, uh, injuries to the area? Like, do you have any falls or anything like that? No, no, I haven't. Okay. Any headaches, nausea or vomiting, fevers or chills, any of those symptoms?

And I'm worried I'm having a heart attack too. Yeah. It was just two weeks ago? Yeah. I'm so sorry to hear that, uh, it must be a really difficult time for you right now. Mm-hmm. Okay, so you're worried you might be having a heart attack as well? Yeah. Okay, so we can definitely, uh, do some, uh, tests and, um, see what, what's going on. Um, I just have a few more questions and then, uh, I'll just get to some of, uh, the management and what we'll be doing for you in the future. So, um, currently right now, do you work at all?

No. Okay. All right, so those are all the questions we had, uh, for you today. And, uh, yeah, it must be really, uh, difficult and scary for you right now to, uh, but we'll make sure to get to the bottom of this, see what's going on. Uh, so what we can do is, uh, get you an ECG to see, uh, how your heart is functioning and then, um, see, get, get any blood work, um, if we need it for the future. But, uh, yeah, right now I would, I would say try not to, uh, worry too much about it right now and see, um, uh, what, what some of those tests, uh, come back. Thank you. So, yeah, you're welcome.
