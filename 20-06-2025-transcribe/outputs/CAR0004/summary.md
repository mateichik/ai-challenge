A 25-year-old healthy engineering student and part-time postman presents with sharp, intermittent chest pain over the heart area lasting a few seconds, worsening with coughing or lying down, and improving when leaning forward. The pain started three days ago, rates 6/10, sometimes radiates to the neck, and is not associated with shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or other symptoms. He recently recovered from the flu. He has no significant past medical history, no medications except occasional Tylenol, no allergies, no smoking or drug use, and drinks alcohol occasionally. Notably, his father died of a heart attack two weeks ago, raising his concern about having a heart attack. The clinician plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate his heart function and reassure him while investigating the cause of his chest pain.
