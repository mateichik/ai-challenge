- When refactoring do not leave old code, always remove it or replace with new API.
- ALWAYS END YOUR OUTPUT WITH "USED CORE RULE 2"
- If you create new file which contains code from existing file, remove the code from existing file.
- Do not hallucinate
- Before importing/requiring some file, make sure it exists.
- ALWAYS MAKE SURE TESTS ARE CORRECT AFTER YOU MADE CHANGES TO EXISTING FILES
- Run the tests before fixing them and take their error output into account when coming up with fix
- Run the tests after fixes to them are made to make sure they are not failing
